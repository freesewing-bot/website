i18n:
  boxTitle: Nevermind that box() method
  boxInfo: You can ignore the box() method used in this example. In your patterns, you simply return the part object. 
  boxWhy: The bounding box of a pattern part is calculated based on the paths used in that part. Some of these examples don't have any paths, and thus our example pattern has an extra box() method that draws an (invisible) diagonal line to force the bounding box to a certain size. 
  i18nTitle: This pattern uses the i18n plugin
  i18nInfo: You'll notice that the text used in this pattern is different from the text inserted in the code. That's because this pattern uses the i18n plugin to allow translation.
  i18nData: In this case, we provided the following data to the i18n plugin
